Basic mini rpg game for the thrill of it, cause I used to love them.
Pretty cool game with these enemies:

·Goblin (80 HP, 5-12 dmg)

·Orc (120, 10-18 dmg)

·Troll (150, 15-25 dmg)


Might add bosses soon as well as actual images cause it's all text, and 
design to make it look less ugly.

These are the current features as of now:

·Inventory

·Leveling

·Mobs/enemies

·Dialogue

·HP and DMG stats for both Player/Enemy.
