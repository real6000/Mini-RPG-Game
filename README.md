#Mini RPG Starter

![Screenshot 1](images/screenshot-1.png)

Basic mini rpg game for the thrill of it, cause I used to love them.

I wish I added some images and cooler designs but I was too lazy and just used CSS lol.

Anyway the website bugged at least 10 times during production.

Pretty cool game with these enemies:

·Goblin (80 HP, 5-12 dmg)

·Orc (120, 10-18 dmg)

·Troll (150, 15-25 dmg)


Might add bosses soon as well as actual images cause it's all text, and 
design to make it look less ugly.

These are the current features as of now:

·Inventory

·Leveling

·Mobs/enemies

·Dialogue

·HP and DMG stats for both Player/Enemy.
